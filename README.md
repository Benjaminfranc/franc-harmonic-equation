# The Franc Harmonic Field Equation

## Scientific Declaration (2025)

**Author: Benjamin D. Franc**

## Overview

This repository contains the official scientific declaration and documentation of the Franc Harmonic Field Equation, a mathematical breakthrough in recursive harmonic field theory discovered by Benjamin D. Franc in 2025.

The Franc Harmonic Field Equation represents a novel integration of Fibonacci mathematics, Faraday's law of induction, and Maxwell's equations into a unified harmonic field model, expressed as:

```
f(φ, n) = (φ^n + φ^(-n))/√5 + ΔΩ · H_n
```

Where:
- φ is the golden ratio (approximately 1.618033988749895)
- n is a positive integer representing the harmonic field node
- ΔΩ is the harmonic field differential operator
- H_n is the n-th harmonic number
